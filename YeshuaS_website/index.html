</h1>
<p>
    These are, in my opinion, the top ten best pies for the holidays. these pies are sure to make your guest very happy!!!
</p>

<h1>

<p>
    These pies are by far the worse ones on this list. They are not even edible! yuck
</p>

<h1>
    9.  Key Lime Pie
</h1>

</a>
<p>
    Don't get me wrong, this is one solid pie right here. It is rich and creamy. It's the fruit that's the problem. Lime is not the best choice forsay.
</p>

<h1>
    8.  Lemon Meringue Pie
</h1>
<a href="https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/easy-lemon-meringue-pie.html">
<img src="/data/lemon_mer_pie.jpeg">
</a>
<p>
    It's for the same reasons as the Key Lime Pie. The only reason it ranks higher is because the tartness is more pronounced in this delectable delight.
</p>

<h1>
    7.  Cherry Pie
</h1>
<a href="https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/cherry-pie/">

</a>
<p>
    An absolute classic this one! Ranks somewhat low because it's a basic, good'old reliable flavor. Only problem is that there are better flavors to choose from.
</p>

<h1>
    6.  Blueberry Pie
</h1>
<a href="https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/blueberry_pie/">
<img src="/data/blue_pie.jpeg">
</a>
<p>
    A truly delectable treat is the clasic Blueberry Pie. It places here on the list because of the same reasons as the Cherry Pie. Ranks higher though because of it's more light and sweet flavor.
</p>

<h1>
    5.  Beef Pot Pie
</h1>
<a href="https://gooddinnermom.com/beef-pot-pie/">

</a>
<p>
    Now this is a pie if I ever saw one. Breaks away from the norm of sweet pies by being rich and savory. And man, does it pay off! Who knew beef tasted so good with a pie crust.
</p>

<h1>
    4.  Pumpkin Pie
</h1>

    Ok so hear me out: I've never actually eaten this pie before. But, my brother did say it tasted really REALLY good, so I'll take his word on it.
</p>

<img src="/data/apple_pie.jpeg">
<p>
    Ah yes, the good'old Apple Pie. You can never go wrong with it. Just about everyone has tasted this simply incredible pie, with it's wonderful flavor, filled with so much ... wonder! Now you might be just a bit surpised that it's not on the number one spot, but you'll see real soon why that's that case. Got a real special one coming for yall next.
</p>

<h1>
    AND FINALLY, NUMBER 1:
</h1>
<h1>
    Chicken Pot Pie
</h1>
<img src="/data/chick_pot_pie.jpeg">
<p>
    This, right here, is, in my humble opinion, the greatest pie that has ever grazed the earth itself. What an absolute experiance this pie is. Taking the best parts of a pie, and then making it into a full, hearty and filling, meal. Absolutly delicious the Chicken Pot Pie is. If you have not have had the incredible pleasure of consuming one of these pies, do yourself a favor, and give it a try. You will NOT regret it!
